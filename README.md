# CLIENT-SERVER-INSTANT-MESSAGING-USING-JAVA
Traditionally, instant messaging is thought to consist of one-to-one chat
rather than many-to-many chat, which is called variously "group chat" or
"text conferencing". Group chat functionality is familiar from systems such
as Internet Relay Chat (IRC) and the chatroom functionality offered by
popular consumer IM services. This project is mainly focused on chatting
and exchanging photos and messages within LAN.
 CLIENT SERVER INSTANT MESSAGING USING JAVA can also be
treated as multi-client application a simple date time server was created
which handled multiple user requests at the same time using threading. It
explains the basic concepts of threading in network programming. The
same concepts can be used with very slight modification to extend the
above idea and create a chatting application like Facebook messenger,
WhatsApp, etc. 
The main objective for building a Client Server Messenger is to provide an advanced
communication platform so that multiple people can communicate with each other at the same
time. All you need is just an internet connection. You can connect to your group of friends
wherever internet connectivity is there. Some of the best examples are Yahoo Messenger, which
is used on large scale for chatting purposes.
